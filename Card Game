PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this project you are going to model a deck of cards and play a simple game, High Card. In the game High Card, the
player is given a bank of $50.
To play the game:
1. The player is dealt a card.
2. After receiving their card, the Player bets between [$1 … $5].
3. The dealer then deals themselves a card.
4. If the Player has the high card, they win their bet. Note their bet was removed from their bank,
so how much goes into their bank?
5. If the Player has the low card, they lose their bet. Note their bet was removed from their bank, so
how much comes out of their bank?
6. If both the player and the dealer have the same face (Ace, King, five, etc) the player’s bank is unaffected
7. The game continues until the Player either loses all their money or until they double their initial bank of
$50.
REPORTS
The steps 1 … 5 comprises a round
After each round print the player’s card, the dealer’s card, the player’s bet and the player’s bank after their winnings
or losses are applied.
After the game is over print “Winner, winner chicken dinner!” if their bank is positive, otherwise print “Sorry for your
loss, please try again when you have more money”.

comments
I can not get it to take the users bet out and if they win then it doubles the bet and if the lose then they just lose what they bet and 
if it ties then the bet gets put back in the bank acount. then I need the game to end when the account goes to 100 or end when the user 
hits zero?
